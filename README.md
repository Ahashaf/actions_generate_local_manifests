### Extract Proprietary Blobs
* Generate your first local_manifests from a list of repos using Github Action.

### Steps
* Fork this repository.
* Go back to Settings > Action > General > Workflow Permissions > Read and write permissions.
* Rename PLE.txt and edit contents to meet your needs

### Notes
* This does not handle conflicts with ROM manifests, as it just generates a simple template. Fix them manually using remove-project.
